# tahini canonical application

the idea here is to provide an example application with
- some common form interactions
- some common network actions
- some less common use cases

which is fully tested unit and e2e

as well as providing walkthroughs on how to build this kina stuff

(badges for coverage, build, dep)

(using ko / create-react-app, ... getting started)

(building a few things -> split into walkthroughs/*whatever.md)

(how to run this crap locally to fuck around with it)
