the goal here is to write the cribbage game through redux, using tahini to keep everything sorted lexically

also featuring:

- deal (random) as a networkHandler to keep components pure
- highly legible user story tests


## ci cd goals:

tahini should enforce 100% coverage on itself and all of its canon apps

only withis will it be worthy of adoption.
