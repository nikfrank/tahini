# cribbage with tahini

the goal here is to write the cribbage game through redux, using tahini to keep everything sorted lexically

also, this will be an opportunity to feature:

- random as a networkHandler !!
- undo perhaps
- remote control perhaps

## ci cd goals:

tahini should enforce 100% coverage on itself and all of its canon apps

only withis will it be worthy of adoption.
