tahini is a framework for react redux immutable applications

it is also a tasty and protein rich sesame sauce which I like to buy in the shuk.

[click here to read about tahini on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahini)

it solves problems of
- state modularity
- component reusability (ie DRYness)
- normalization / serializability of actions
- app wide metaprogramming

Anyone with more saucy puns for this list is encouraged to open a PR.

Tahini is opinionated and yet tries to not impose / cramp your style.

For example, it takes only one line of code to put tahini on your existing component sandwich!

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {render} from 'react-dom';

import './index.css';

import { bootApp, networkMiddleware } from 'tahini';

class Sandwich extends React.Component {
  render(){
    return (
      <div>
        this Sandwich has tahini on it!
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const rootRoute = {
  routePath:'/',
  componentClass:Home,
};

import networkHandlers from './network/';

render(
  bootApp( [ networkMiddleware(networkHandlers) ], rootRoute ),
  document.getElementById('root')
);

```

great - you may say - that was easy and definitely made my sandwich tastier and more nutritious!

Or - more likely you will say - that does nothing! And it was sortof more than one line of code.

Very well, so now you can read about what we can do now that there's tahini on our Sandwich Component.

## Scoped Actions and Reducers

```jsx
class Sandwich extends React.Component {
  get actions(){
    return { whatever: (...args)=>({ type:'whatever', payload:args }),.. } 
  }
  get reducer(){
    return { whatever: (subState, action)=> subState.set('whatever', fromJS(action.payload),.. }
  }
}
```

Here I've written a bullshit example to show you how the actions and reducers can be coupled to a Sandwich

Ok, so how do I call whatever action creator, and wtf is subState?


```jsx
// demo of calling this.props.actionCreator
// explanation of state mutation therefrom
```

## subStates

... explanation of subStates, default behaviour or the boot process



## network layer

infrastructure, vocabulary

### network handlers

- demo consuming a CRUD API
- demo connecting to a socket
- demo RTC chat application ((!))

future development will be geared toward:
- test legibility and brevity
- network modules for sockets / RTC
- middleware for redo/ undo, remote control, bug reproducer
- serialized JSON routing
- react native, isomorphism

## Philosophical crap you can read if you're bored

### State Management

React made good on SOCg state logic out of view ctrls, but it caused us the issue of global scope for that state.

Currently popular are state management abstract components, which are largely unreusable and quite frankly an unelegant solution. 

Tahini allows you to localize components to subStates recursively (similar to using functions to enclose lexical scopes recursively), which has some added benefits (super modularization, reusability, minimize cognitive overhead) for really not much extra work to you.


### Serializable Actions

I think serializable actions are kodesh. There are untold possibilities to keep actions that way, where any benefit of replacing them with thunks or promises or observables can be made modularly and unopinionatedly.

Network or other async behaviours have a simple interface that can handle any of these libraries while maintaining the serializability of the actions!

This is the homoiconic powerhouse of your app. Don't fuck it up!


### Reflection

Metaprogramming is super useful, but difficult to explain why to people who have never learned a LISP or done psychedelics.

The point is to maintain flexibility as project size increases. ie, you never have to say "shit I wish we had known we were going to have to make that feature a month ago, we would've made totally different architecture decisions!"

When you can reason more abstractly about your app from within itself, you'll be able to overcome your own legacy stupidity :)

## future dev

((react native integration & isomorphism))

((reified management concept, using it to resolve action triggers))

((performance characterization, investigate propriety of lifecycle use))

((unsubscribe from partial substate))

((JSON serial routing))

- test legibility and brevity
- network modules for sockets / RTC
- middleware for redo/ undo, remote control, bug reproducer

middleware/ network layer CACHE (with its own redux store?)
could be used for "get at least # of something" queries
or offline mode
would sit in front of the standard network middleware

(ko cli tooling)

(use w create-react-app, or whatever else is cool)

(use w webpack css tooling)

besides for "owning" part of the total app state, are there any other more useful selection strategies?
